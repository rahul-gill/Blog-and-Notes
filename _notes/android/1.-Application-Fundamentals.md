# Introduction
- each app is a different user with a linux user id assigned by system which is unknown to app
- by default each app runs in its own linux process and each process has its own VM
- its possible to arrange two apps to have same user id so they can access each others files and share the same VM(they must be signed with same certificate)
- applications have an `Application` class which is declared in manifest
# Core App Components    
- entry points through which system or a user can enter the app
## Activities
- represents a single screen with a user interface for interacting with the user
- each activity is independent of others
- a different app can also start any of these activities
- implemented as subclass of `Activity` class

## Services
- component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations or to perform work for remote processes.
- doesn't provide a user interface
- two types of services based on how the system handles them
	- music playback kind which the user is directly aware of. app tells the system this by saying it wants to be foreground with a notification to tell the user about it. So system knows that it should try keeping that service's process running
	- regular background services. System has more freedom in managing its process. It may be killed (and then restarting it later) if RAM is needed.
### errrrrrrrrrr
- these run because some app wants to make use of it(service is providing API to another process)
- input methods, accessibility services, notification listeners, screen savers, live wallpapers etc
- implemented as subclass of `Service` class
*some `JobScheduler` class was mentitioned*	

## Broadcast Receivers

- enables the system to deliver events to the app outside of a regular user flow(respond to system-wide broadcast announcements)
- since these are another well defined entry in the app, system can deliver broadcast messages even if apps are note running
- many broadcasts originate from system. for example battery low, screen off, etc.
- apps can broadcast also, for example notifying some data is downloaded
- Don't display user interface but can create a status bar notification
- intended to do very minimal work
- implemented as subclass of `BroadcastReceiver` class, each broadcast is delivered as an `Intent` object

## Content Providers

- manages a shared set of app data that you can store in the file system, in a SQLite database, on the web, or on any other persistent storage location that your app can access
- Its an entry point into an app for publishing named data items, identified by a URI scheme and app can decide how it wants to map the data to a URI namespace
- URIs can persist after owning apps have exited, so it doesn't require the app to be running
- Provide fine-grained security model, for example an app attempts to access some URI, the system can this via a temporary URI permission grant. The app is allowed to access the data only behind that URI, but nothing else in the second app.
- implemented as subclass of `ContentProvider` class, must implement a standard set of APIs that enable other apps to perform transaction

## Activating components
- Activities, services and broadcast receivers are activated by an asynchronous message called intent
- Intents bind individual components with each other at runtime, kind of messengers which request an action from other components(of same or different app)
- For activities & services, intent defines the action to perform (for example, to view or send something) and may specify the URI of the data to act on, among other things that the component being started might need to know
- For broadcast receivers, the intent simply defines the announcement being broadcast(for example, a broadcast to indicate the device battery is low includes only a known action string that indicates battery is low)
- Content providers are activated when targeted by a request from a `ContentResolver`. This adds a layer of abstraction(for security)
# Mainfest File

- `AndroidManifest.xml` file
    - declares app's components(application class, activities etc.)
    - indentifies any user permissions the app requires
    - declare the minimum API level required by the app
    - declare hardware and software features required by the app
    - Declares API libraries the app needs to be linked against (other than the Android framework APIs)
- activities, services and content providers can never run if not declared in the manifest, however, broadcast receivers can be created dynamically as `BroadcastReceiver` objects and received with the system by calling `registerReceiver()`
- declaring component capabilities
    - explicitly name the target component in intent OR
    - declare an intent-filter as a child of the component declaration for implicit intent
    - Do not declare intent filters for services, User cannot see which service starts and it can be a hazard to start a service by implicit intent.
- declaring app requirements
    - system doesn't read them but extenal services such as Google Play do
        
    - `minSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` are set in app module's `build.gradle` file, don't set these directly in the manifest file as they'll be overwritten during gradle build process
        
        ```
        android {
          ...
          defaultConfig {
            ...
            minSdkVersion 26
            targetSdkVersion 29
          }
        }
        ```
        
    - declaring camera feature required
        
        ```
        <manifest ... >
            <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.any"
                          android:required="true" />
            ...
        </manifest>
        
        ```
        

# App resources
- resources seperate from the code such as images, audio files etc.
- for every resource included in the android project, the SDK build tools define a unique integer ID, which can be used to reference the resource from app code or from other resources defined in XML
- qualifier is a short string that you include in the name of your resource directories in order to define the device configuration for which those resources should be used

# An android project contains:
- code files
- resources
- mainfest file
- gradle scripts

# User Permissions

- in the manifest

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

- permission checker and requester functions

```
private fun hasStorageAccessGranted() =
        ActivityCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, android.Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE) == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED
```

```
private fun askForPermission(){//call in the button onClickListener
    val permissionsToRequest = mutableListOf<String>()
    if(!hasStorageAccessGranted()){
        permissionsToRequest.add(android.Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)
    }
    if(permissionsToRequest.isNotEmpty()){
        ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(this, permissionsToRequest.toTypedArray(), 0)
    }
}
```

- logging result

```
override fun onRequestPermissionsResult(
        requestCode: Int,////to differentiate different permission requests
        permissions: Array<out String>,
        grantResults: IntArray//granted permissions
    ) {
        super.onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults)
        if(requestCode == 0 && grantResults.isNotEmpty()){
            for(i in grantResults.indices){
                if(grantResults[i] == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED){ Log.d("MainActivityPermissions"," ${permissions[i]} granted") }
            }
        }
    }
```
