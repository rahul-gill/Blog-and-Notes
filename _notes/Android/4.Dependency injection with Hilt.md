- create an annotated application class and add its name to manifest
```kotlin
@HiltAndroidApp
class MyApplication: Application()
```

- create a new package di and add a class `AppModule`
```kotlin
@Module
@InstallIn(ApplicationComponent::class)
object AppModule{
	//example for providing glide
	@Singleton
	@Provides
	fun provideGlideInstance(
		@ApplicationContext context: Context
	) = Glide.with(context).setDefaultRequestOptions(
		RequestOptions()
			.placeholder(R.drawable.ic_image_for_not_loaded_image)
			.error(R.drawable.ic_image_when_error_occur)
			.diskCacheStrategy(DiskCacheStrategy.DATA)
	)
}
```
- add these packages according to lifecycle needs

- then in the component in which injection is to be done, annotate that with
```
@AndroidEntryPoint
```
